The Angel Light

Once upon a time, there was a little boy who was afraid of the dark.

Every night, he tried to fall asleep with the light on, but at some point, his mom would always come in and turn it off.

He’d lie in bed, scared, with the blanket pulled all the way up to his face. He wanted to sleep, but he just couldn’t. The darkness felt too big.

One day, while searching through a messy closet for a toy he had lost, the boy found something strange—something he had never seen before.

It looked like a tiny angel, made of plastic and metal, with an outlet prong sticking out of its back.

Curious, he took it to the nearest wall and plugged it in.

As soon as it lit up, a soft, magical glow filled the room. It wasn’t just bright—it was beautiful. The light shimmered like stardust and wrapped around everything like a gentle hug.

That night, after his mom turned out the bedroom light, he quietly plugged in the angel.

The glow filled his room again, warm and comforting. He felt safe. Protected. Like something was watching over him.

From that night on, the boy slept peacefully.

He even began to dream of the angel. In his dreams, it would take his hand and fly him through moonlit skies, gliding above the trees and stars.

He used the angel light every night. He never let it out of his sight. Even when the sun came up, he kept it close—because it made him feel safe.

And warm.

And loved.

The end.
